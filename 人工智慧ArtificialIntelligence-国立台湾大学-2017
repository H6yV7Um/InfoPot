Artificial Intelligence A Modern Approach (3rd Edition)
1-1 What is AI(i) - Acting Humanly, Thinking Humanly
1. What is AI?
		Human  Rational
Think 	
Act

the textbook advocates acting rationally.


Strong AI vs. Weak AI - John Searle
Strong AI : A physicla symbol system can have a mind and mental states.
Weak AI: A phisical symbol system can act intelligently.

The textbook advocatres weak AI.

1-2 What is AI(i) - Thinking Rationally, Acting Rationally
Thinking Humanly: Cognitive Modeling
How to validate? Requires
	top-down	:Predicting and testing behavior of human subjects  -- cognitive science
	bottom-up	: Direct identification from neurological data		-- cognitive neuroscience

Chinese Room Argument by John Searle
Book of RULES
So P is note sufficient for producing understanding of Chinese.
So there is no program sufficient for producing understanding of Chinese.

Acting Rationally: Rational Agent
An agent is an entity that perceives and acts.

percept histories -> actions

1-4 Agents and Environments, Rationality, PEAS
Human agents 
Robotic agents



Agents and Environments
sensors actuators 失真

agent function
| 失真	f : P* -> A
| 		*:0 or 多个
agent program is the implementaion of an agent function


Vacuum Cleaner
Percepts: Location and Contents,
			e.g.[B, Dirty]
Actions: Left, Right, Suck, NoOp.

A Vacuum-Cleaner Agent
P* -> A
Percept Sequence 	Action

Is it needed to list the state [A, clean],[A, clean]?
Yes, because there are still some accidents that make the action "right" fail, or other unknown reasons to get[A, clean] again. For safety purpose, we need to list all possible states.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rationality

Performance measure  according to 
	What one actually wants in the environment
A rational agent maximizes the expected performance.
Rational != Omniscience
	Percepts may not supply all relevant information.
Rational != Clairvoyant
	Action outcomes maynote be as expected.
Rational => information gathering, exploration, learning, autonomy.

1-5 Environment Types, Summary
Environment Types
				Chess	Poker	Taxi	Image analysis
Obervability
Agents
Deterministic/stochastic
Episodic/sequential
Static/dynamic
Discrete/continuous

the real world is partially observable, stochastic, dequential, dynamic, continuous, multi-agent

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Agent Types
Four basic types in order of increasing generality
1. Simple reflex agents
	Vacuum Cleaner
	condition-action rules
	memory-less/state-less
	P->A
	Works only if the environment is fully observable.

2. Model-based agents
	condition-action rules
	state + sensors
	partical observability
	internal states to model the world
	best guess

3. Goal-based agents
	Instead of using condition-action rules, the agent uses goals to decide what action it does.
	Search(bottom-up) and Planning(top-down)

4. utility-based agents
	Utility function: Happiness of the agent
	Maximizing the expected utility.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Learning Agents
Sensors 				Actuators
		Performance element
Critic	Learning element	Problem generator

Learning from rewards(or penalty)
Learning techniques form another field called machine learning.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
Strong vs. weak AI
Agetns interact with environments through actuators and sensors.
The agent function describes what the agent does in all circumstances.
The performance measure evaluates the environment sequence.
A perfetly rational agent maximizes expected performance.
Agetn programs implemet (some) agent functions.
PEAS descriptions define task environmetns.
Different envrionment & agent types.
all agents can improve their performances through learning.
